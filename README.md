# Machine Learning Projects

Projects based on Hands on Machine Learning book. The projects however, use a different dataset than the one used in the projects.

## Bike Sharing

This project is based on chapter 2 of the book. It aims to create a model that predicts how many bikes will be rented in a given hour, on a given day given the weather constraints.
